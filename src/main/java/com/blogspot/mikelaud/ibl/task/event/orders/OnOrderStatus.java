		 *                           when an order is submitted.
		 *     PendingCancel - indicates that you have sent a request to cancel
		 *                     the order but have not yet received cancel confirmation
		 *                     from the order destination. At this point, your order

		 *                    by the IB system and that this order has yet to be elected.
		 *                    The order is held in the IB system until the election

		 *     Submitted - indicates that your order has been accepted
		 *                 at the order destination and is working.
		 *     Cancelled - indicates that the balance of your order has been confirmed
		 *                 canceled by the IB system. This could occur unexpectedly
		 *                 when IB or the destination has rejected your order.
		 *     Filled - indicates that the order has been completely filled.
		 *     Inactive - indicates that the order has been accepted by the system
		 *                (simulated orders) or an exchange (native orders)
		 *                but that currently the order is inactive due to system,
